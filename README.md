I just stumbled out of Flight Risk, eyes kind of blurry and head a little bit of a mess. Like, what the hell did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? It’s like someone took a paint roller to my feelings and splattered them on the walls of my mind. Kind of want to give a high five to the director for the whiplash but also maybe a sarcastic slow clap for the sheer insanity of it all.

I mean, the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 starts like this tame little drama about a pilot (who's probably spent too much time in his airplane, ifykwim), and suddenly it’s like, bam – now you’re in a mid-air hostage situation with more plot twists than a twisted Red Vine. The cinematography was on point, though, a visual hodgepodge like those kaleidoscope toys you take to a bonfire and stare into, thinking you're seeing a new universe. Dang, am I even making sense? No apologies for my exhausted brain here.

Let's talk about the characters for a second. These guys felt like I knew them from some old dream, but not quite. It’s like the scriptwriters met these people at a gas station, late at night, ran them through a '90s Windows screensaver, and boom, character development! Polarizing, that's for sure. I can't decide if I wanted to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 this   already just to pause on their expressions and decipher them like cryptic New Yorker cartoons.

> Then there’s the music – oh man, part opera, part bad karaoke in a bar lit by neon signs, and somehow it works? At least half the time, the sound was the only thing keeping my brain glued to the story. One moment you’re cheering for the main dude hoping desperately he doesn’t crash and burn (literally), and the next you're nodding along thinking, yeah, I can see why he’d just fly straight into the sunset and leave all earthly troubles behind.

Okay, pause, fervent side note. Did anyone else notice the close-up shots of the hands? Like, all the time. The director must have some thing with fingers intersecting with levers like some kind of poetic ballet. It had me irrationally pondering about the hidden meaning behind hand gestures. It’s gotta be symbolic or whatever, but come on, I’m not writing my thesis here.

Upside downside mixed with a little confusion. That sums it up, I think? Go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   - or don’t, if airline intrigue with a side of existential crisis isn’t your thing. Personally, I’d say grab the popcorn, and set your expectations for a whirl.

Here's a rando code snippet it made me think of, don’t ask:

```cpp
#include <io𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮>
int main() {
   std::string pilot = Fly high!;
   std::cout << pilot << std::endl;
   return 0;
}
```

Long story short – am I glad I saw it? Sure, why not. It’s a flight you kind of want to stay on just for the thrill of not knowing if you’ll land safely in coherent plot territory. But then again, isn’t life just like that sometimes? Guess I’ll just let this one simmer and circle back if the mood to re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 strikes.
